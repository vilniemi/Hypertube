Retrospect:

This project was really fast, with four different skilled people. In the beginning we talked about what we do and about the stack, we decided to use the t3 stack introduced by Jukka (it looked cool to me) but with some resistance of just doing the old thing and progress fast. But in the end I really learned a lot with it and others too so it was good choice. The beginning of the project I was chosen to be working with frontend with Omar, we decided I just do the logic part of it and not the visual design. I was learning the trpc and prisma and teaching it to Luke week one. Then I was thinking this project is too fast, and we are doing something wrong with so many api calls to yit. Every team member of the project had some good part, Luke is doing the streaming, Omar is doing UI, Jukka is doing devops and user management. So what is left for me? I decided I need do the search for movies good with filters. First I downloaded all the movies data (about 45k) from yit and save the meta-data to be able to seed to our db. I generated a script to refresh our db daily with new movies. Now we have the continous search and not wasted api calls! Allso as a bonus our system is robust and we got many more filters that is not really available as default from yit. In the end I was doing optimizations for the webpack size. We just decided to leave the project as it is because the evaluation was going to be too difficult with one team member already working on job.
